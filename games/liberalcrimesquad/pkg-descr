Liberal Crime Squad is an ASCII game centered around replacing the conservative
far-right government with a more liberal left-wing government, through methods
such as handing out pamphlets, convincing people to join your group, or raiding
conservative locations, killing people on sight. Originally made by
Bay 12 Games, the creators of Dwarf Fortress, it was eventually abandoned and
released under an open source license and is now maintained by the community.
