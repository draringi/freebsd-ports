Libslack is a library of general utilities designed to make UNIX/C programming a bit easier on the eye. It's a small library with lots of functionality, accurately documented and thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed on the principle that common operations should always be easy to write and code should always be easy to read.
